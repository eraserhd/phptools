phptools README
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

phptools is a collection of utilities for manipulating PHP source.  These tools
are based around a bigloo-Scheme PHP scanner and parser.  Here are the tools
I plan to implement:

	phpindent		- Reindent PHP sourcecode.
	phpcheck		- Syntax checker (will probably just be a
				  symlink to phplint).  Some additonal
				  options:
				  * Enforce different naming conventions.
				  * Enforce indentation.
				  The idea is to use this in CVS commit
				  checks to prevent bad commits.
	phplint			- Check for dead code and security violations
				  (passing tainted variables to database
				  query functions, for example).  Will have
				  lots of options to check for some things
				  which really bug me:
				  * Warn on `global'd variables which aren't
				    referenced.
				  * Missing htmlspecialchars() in output.
	phptags			- Scan sources and make a ctags or etags file.
	phpdoc			- There are two already, not counting my
				  hackish-but-working version which needs
				  to know more about syntax.
	phpcall			- Print call graph.
